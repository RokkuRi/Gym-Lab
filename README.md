# The Gym
___

This is a directory I use for *experimentation* and *training*. All in order
to sharpen my skills and learn new stuff. Something I find
thoroughly revitalizing.

Below is the (current) list of technologies I am learning at the moment:

1. CSS
2. HTML
3. Javascript
4. Git
5. Markdown
6. Rails
7. Ruby
8. SQL

This list does not encompass all of the technology I would like to get
familiar with in the long term, but is something I feel comfortable
starting with.
